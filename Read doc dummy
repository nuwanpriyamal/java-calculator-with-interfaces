I have written a "dummy" code, because i need to understand a concept, then apply it to other programs. So, help me solve this dummy code, it is not homework.
what i need is:
1. how to use a boolean properly.
2. use the object num in the tester // i dont know why it doesnt work.
3. make a do-while in the tester, so it will ask "enter a number" until the user enters a number greater than 10. if the user enters less than 10 i want the program to loop the question until done right.
import java.util.Scanner;
public class K
{
int goodData;
int num;
public K(int num)
{
this.num = num;
}
public boolean getGoodData()
{
if(num > 10)
return true;
return false;
}
public int getNum()
{
return num;
}
}
class Ktester
{
public static void main (String [] args)
{
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
do
{
System.out.println("enter a number: ");
int num = input.nextInt();
K dido = new K(num);
}
while(dido.num);
}
}
